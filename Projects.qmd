In the Summer of 2024 I participated in my Watershed Capstone course for my minor in Watershed Science. This is my final paper summarizing some of the most interesting concepts I learned.

During this field practicum and discussed within this project I gained insights into:

-   Agricultural water efficiency and application

-   Municipal water facilities and management

-   Reclamation and treatment facilities in Colorado

In my final semester of my studies at Colorado State University, I have begun my Capstone project under my minor in Watershed Sciences. This project, focusing on the Elwha River Dam Removal Project, the largest dam removal in US history, will look into the efficacy and consequences of such large ecological restorations.

Objectives of my project include:

-   Utilize high-resolution aerial imagery pre & post removal to track above-dam and below-dam channel changes

-   Analyze peak stream flow associations with channel changes, utilizing a downstream USGS river gauge

## ESS 330 - COVID Analyses

In this lab, we practiced or data analysis skills in working with US COVID data, analyzing cases and deaths. We also looked to analyze the data spatially, looking for patterns in the data when placing the data on a map.
