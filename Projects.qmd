In the Summer of 2024 I participated in my Watershed Capstone course for my minor in Watershed Science. This is my final paper summarizing some of the most interesting concepts I learned.

During this field practicum and discussed within this project I gained insights into:

-   Agricultural water efficiency and application

-   Municipal water facilities and management

-   Reclamation and treatment facilities in Colorado
